4. Zipping and Unzipping
Initially we need to install the required libraries using the command "sudo apt install zip unzip"

Compress the test_dir directory into a file named test_dir.zip using zip.
command -   zip -r test_dir.zip test_dir
"zip" command is used to create a compressed zip following "-r" denotes recursive to handle sub direcotires and "test_dir.zip" stands for name of the zipped file and "test_dir" is the directory which is zipped.


Unzip test_dir.zip into a new directory named unzipped_dir.
command -   mkdir unzipped_dir
            unzip test_dir.zip -d unzipped_dir
"unzip" command used to decompress a zip file with "test_dir.zip" specifies the file that is to be decompressed and "-d unzipped_dir" specifies the destination.
