2. Viewing File Contents
First we need to create a file either by terminal or using the "nano <filename>" command

Use cat to display the contents of /etc/passwd.
command - cat passwd
"cat" command used to fetch the content of file specified without opening it in terminal itsellf.


Display only the first 5 lines of /etc/passwd using head.
command - head -n 5 passwd
"head" command itself states the head of content where "-n 5" specifies the required content

Display only the last 5 lines of /etc/passwd using tail.
command - tail -n 5 passwd
"tail" command itself states the tail or bottom part of content where same as above "-n 5" specifies required content.
